The drush command 'dcr' could not be found.  Run `drush          [error]
cache-clear drush` to clear the commandfile cache if you have
installed new extensions.
Drush was not able to start (bootstrap) the Drupal database.     [error]
Hint: This may occur when Drush is trying to:
 * bootstrap a site that has not been installed or does not
have a configured database. In this case you can select
another site with a working database setup by specifying the
URI to use with the --uri parameter on the command line. See
`drush topic docs-aliases` for details.
 * connect the database through a socket. The socket file may
be wrong or the php-cli may have no access to it in a jailed
shell. See http://drupal.org/node/1428638 for details.
